Task 1:

Objective

For the first stage, you will write a bot who displays a greeting, its name, and the year it was created. First impressions count!

Your program should print the following lines:

Hello! My name is {bot_name}.
I was created in {birth_year}.

Instead of {bot_name}, print any name you choose and replace {birth_year} with the current year (four digits). You don't need to take any input in this stage.
Example

Output:

Hello! My name is Aid.
I was created in 2023.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Task 2:

Objective

In this stage, you will introduce yourself to the bot so that it can greet you by your name.

Your program should print the following lines:

Hello! My name is Aid.
I was created in 2023.
Please, remind me your name.
What a great name you have, {your_name}!

You may change the name and the creation year of your bot if you want.

Instead of {your_name}, the bot must print your name entered from the standard input.
Example

The greater-than symbol followed by a space (> ) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.

Example 1: a dialogue with the bot

Hello! My name is Aid.
I was created in 2023.
Please, remind me your name.
> Max
What a great name you have, Max!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Task 3:

Objective

In this stage, you will introduce yourself to the bot. It will greet you by your name and then try to guess your age using arithmetic operations.

Your program should print the following lines:

Hello! My name is Aid.
I was created in 2023.
Please, remind me your name.
What a great name you have, Max!
Let me guess your age.
Enter remainders of dividing your age by 3, 5 and 7.
Your age is {your_age}; that's a good time to start programming!

Read three numbers from the standard input. Assume that all the numbers will be given on separate lines.

Instead of {your_age}, the bot will print the age determined according to the special formula discussed above.
Example

The greater-than symbol followed by a space (> ) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.

Example 1: a dialogue with the bot

Hello! My name is Aid.
I was created in 2023.
Please, remind me your name.
> Max
What a great name you have, Max!
Let me guess your age.
Enter remainders of dividing your age by 3, 5 and 7.
> 1
> 2
> 1
Your age is 22; that's a good time to start programming!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Task 4:

Objective

In this stage, you will program the bot to count from 0 to any positive number users enter.
Example

The greater-than symbol followed by a space (> ) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.

Example 1: a dialogue with the new version of the bot

Hello! My name is Aid.
I was created in 2023.
Please, remind me your name.
> Max
What a great name you have, Max!
Let me guess your age.
Enter remainders of dividing your age by 3, 5 and 7.
> 1
> 2
> 1
Your age is 22; that's a good time to start programming!
Now I will prove to you that I can count to any number you want.
> 5
0 !
1 !
2 !
3 !
4 !
5 !
Completed, have a nice day!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Task 5:

Objective

Your bot can ask anything you want, but there are two rules for your output:

    the line with the test should end with the question mark character;
    an option starts with a digit followed by the dot (1., 2., 3., 4.)

If a user enters an incorrect answer, the bot may print a message:

Please, try again.

The program should stop on the correct answer and print Congratulations, have a nice day! at the end.
Example

The greater-than symbol followed by a space (> ) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.

Example 1: a dialogue with the final version of your bot

Hello! My name is Aid.
I was created in 2023.
Please, remind me your name.
> Max
What a great name you have, Max!
Let me guess your age.
Enter remainders of dividing your age by 3, 5 and 7.
> 1
> 2
> 1
Your age is 22: that's a good time to start programming!
Now I will prove to you that I can count to any number you want.
> 3
0 !
1 !
2 !
3 !
Let's test your programming knowledge.
Why do we use methods?
1. To repeat a statement multiple times.
2. To decompose a program into several small subroutines.
3. To determine the execution time of a program.
4. To interrupt the execution of a program.
> 4
Please, try again.
> 2
Congratulations, have a nice day!
